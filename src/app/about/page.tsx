        During my Computer Science career, I always felt that all my classmates
        had at least one favorite class, but I was already halfway through my
        degree and couldn&apos;t find anything that motivated me to continue at
        the university. In 2018, while studying for final exams, someone handed
        me a small piece of paper advertising a developer position for a new
        project, but I chose to ignore it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        &quot;
        <span className="gradient font-bold">It&apos;s probably a scam</span> or
        something.&quot;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When the semester finally ended, I arrived home and began unpacking
        everything in my backpack. At that moment, that small piece of paper
        reappeared.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        &quot;Should I send them my CV? I really don&apos;t have much to lose.{" "}
        <span className="gradient font-bold">
          What&apos;s the worst that could happen?
        </span>{" "}
        They&apos;re offering a decent salary for a student also.&quot;
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        So I sent an email asking about the position, and thanks to that small
        moment of motivation,{" "}
        <span className="gradient font-bold">my life changed completely</span>.
        I started working on a project that didn&apos;t even have a name yet,
        and three years later, in 2021, it would be present in Colombia, Mexico,
        Chile, Brazil, and Panama. I learned what it&apos;s like to be part of
        the beginning of a startup, to build a project from scratch, to raise
        capital, to lead teams, to understand the product, its requirements, and
        how to grow exponentially. But most importantly, I learned that the
        motivation I had been seeking years before was found in those{" "}
        <span className="gradient font-bold">
          projects that aim to improve our day-to-day lives
        </span>
        , one step at a time.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>I enjoy designing, developing, cooking, photographing and gaming.</p>
